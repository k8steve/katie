			"My producer, Block on Da Trakk, used to DJ back in the day and made tracks, and I used to say, ‘Put me on the track, man!’ And they used to be laughing, thinkin’ I’m playing, and they didn’t like the lifestyle I was living or whatever. Blockhead called me one day last summer and was like, ‘I need you to stay off the streets, I need you to stay out of trouble. I got this beat for you, come over to my house when you get a chance.’ And I was laying in the bed like, ‘I ain’t got nothing to do today, it’s raining and it’s hot.’ It was the day before my birthday last year, July 21, and I recorded ‘I Need a Hitta’."

			".. I’m gonna set a trend for female artists, because people always think you have to sell yourself if you’re a female. I respect myself because I’m a young lady before anything, and a lot of DJs and producers are saying, ‘I don’t listen to female artists, but when I came across Katie I had to fuck with her music!’"
